=============

Hello visitors to my coding world!

I am learning how to be a kick-ass developer at USQ. 
I've dabbled in C++, PHP, Bash, and Ruby. I love to learn
languages and find the differences across them amazing. So, here I
will be storing my Hello World programs across a range of programming languages.
